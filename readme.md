The task of mobile friendly email design seems like it's going to be painful.  
This is my attempt to make it cleaner.  

This update adds the ability to add outlook conditional comments via a <mobile> tag. 

This inliner now interprets this (<mobile> tag):  

`
<mobile>
The content here will only be visiable on mobile devices
</mobile>
`
as this:
`
<!--<![if mso]-->
<div class="show-mobile" style="display:none; width:0px; max-height:0px; overflow:hidden; mso-hide:all; line-height: 0px;" >
The content here will only be visiable on mobile devices
</div>
<!--<![endif]-->
`

the .hide-mobile class can be used to hide elements from mobile clients.
[small]however for it to work in gmail it must be a div element it can't be a table element (because gmail converts them to divs and I'm guessing the inline style is lost there)[/small]

`
                        .show-mobile{
                          display:none;
                          width:0px;
                          max-height:0px;
                          overflow:hidden;  
                          mso-hide:all;
                          line-height: 0px;
                        }

                        @media only screen and (max-device-width: 480px) {

                            body[yahoo] .show-mobile {
	                            display:block !important;
	                            margin: 0;
	                            padding:0;
	                            overflow : visible !important;
	                            width:auto !important;
	                            max-height:inherit !important;
	                            line-height: auto !important; 
                            }

                            body[yahoo] .hide-mobile{
								display:none;
								width:0px;
								max-height:0px;
								overflow:hidden;
								overflow:hidden !important;
                            }
						}
